Week 1-2: System Design & Basic Implementation

    Define Agent Roles and Interactions:
        - Occupant Agents: Simulate occupants who follow evacuation routes. Each agent has a starting position, mobility status, and awareness of exits.
        - Building Management Agents: Manage building systems, control exit doors, and send updates about emergencies (e.g., fire or blocked exits).
        - Communication: Occupant agents receive real-time evacuation information from the building management agents.

    Initial Implementation:
        - Set up a basic system using SPADE (or JADE) to model the agents. Start with Occupant Agents and Building Management System Agents.
        - Movement Algorithm: Implement a simple algorithm where each occupant moves toward the nearest exit based on static conditions.

Week 3: Emergency Responder Agents & Dynamic Conditions

    Emergency Responder Agents:
        - Responders assist in guiding occupants or helping the injured. They can reroute people and manage blocked exits.
        - Responders communicate with Building Management Agents to get real-time building info (e.g., fire spread).
    Simulating Dynamic Conditions:
        - Introduce changes in the environment, such as fires, blocked exits, or damaged areas. Use a time-based simulation where fires spread and certain areas become inaccessible.

Week 4: Evacuation Optimization & Advanced Communication

    Evacuation Optimization:
        - Develop an algorithm that dynamically reroutes occupants based on current conditions, such as fire spread or crowded exits.
        - Consider graph-based routing or A* search algorithms to find optimal paths under changing conditions.
    Advanced Communication Protocols:
        - Enhance the system to allow for multi-agent communication between occupants, responders, and building systems.
        - Implement protocols for sharing information about blocked exits, safe zones, and responder locations.

Week 5: Performance Metrics & System Resilience

    Performance Metrics:
        - Track metrics such as evacuation time, safety (how many agents successfully evacuate), and responder effectiveness (how fast responders assist occupants).
        - Implement logging and analysis of these metrics to identify bottlenecks in evacuation strategies.

    System Resilience:
        - Simulate failures like communication breakdowns or blocked paths and evaluate how agents respond. Ensure the system can continue functioning with partial information.

Week 6: User Interface & Testing

    User Interface:
        - Develop a simple UI to visualize the evacuation process. Show building layout, fire spread, and occupant movements in real-time.
        - Allow for scenario configuration (e.g., different building layouts or emergency types).

    Testing:
        Test the system under various conditions, including fast and slow emergencies, different agent distributions, and blocked exits. Make adjustments based on testing outcomes.
